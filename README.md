# 0. The Brief

### Introduction

Build a React Application that models a User Login and Register System.  This system needs to show your knowledge of:
*	React
*	ReactStrap
*	Router
*	Snapshot testing

Your React application should make use of the provided Node Backend.

### Planning 

Plan out this application by:
1.	 Creating your wireframes.
2.	 Deciding on your components.
3.	 Deciding on a Component Hierarchy
4.	 Deciding where the state should be stored.

### User Stories:
#### User Story 1: 
<p>
As a user, I can register to the system by providing a valid username, valid email and verified password.
</p>

#### User Story 2: 
<p>
As a user, I want to then be able to login using this username and password.
</p>

#### User Story 3: 
<p>
As a user, I want to be able to see a list of the usernames of other users.
</p>

#### User Story 4: 
<p>
As a user, I want the system to inform me when I am trying to register with incorrect details.
</p>

#### User Story 5: 
<p>
As a user, I want to be informed when I am logging in with data that is inaccurate (hint: use the results from the post request to help you).

* QA consulting and our fantastic instructors
* https://github.com/matt25969/node_user_login formed the base of my backend, which has been modified in order to fulfil the assessment requirements, hence the modified version is included in this repo in the UserLoginBackend folder.
